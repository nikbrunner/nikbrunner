# Hi there 👋

My Name is Nik

I'm from Landshut, Bavaria 🏔.

I'm am working for [DealerCenter Digital](https://bike.center/).

My favourite technologies are `#react`, `#typescript`, `#scss`, `#git` and `#vim`.

I'm currently learning advanced `#redux` and `#typescript`, `#bash` and `#vim`.

To calm down, relax and change perspective I enjoy nature, photography, philosophy and science.
